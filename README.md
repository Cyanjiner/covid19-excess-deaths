# covid19-excess-deaths
This is a research project on estimating excess mortality during COVID-19 in four countries: US, UK, Brazil, and Russia using ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average), GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity), VAR (Vector autoregression), and Neural Networks/LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) models.

The dataset used in this project comes from [the World Mortality Dataset](https://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality), which contains country-level data on deaths from all causes in 2015-2021 collected from various resources.

Source code in this research can be found in [excess-deaths.rmd](https://github.com/Cyanjiner/covid19-excess-deaths/blob/main/excess-deaths.Rmd).
